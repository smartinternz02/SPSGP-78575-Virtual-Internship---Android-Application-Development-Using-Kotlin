# Project: Build A Grocery Android [[DEMO](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SPSGP-78575-Virtual-Internship---Android-Application-Development-Using-Kotlin/blob/main/demo.mp4)]

## Project Problem Statement

As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to convey my heartfelt gratitude to Mr Sandeep Doodigani for his tremendous direction and assistance in the completion of my project. I would also like to thank him for providing me with this wonderful opportunity to work on a project with the topic Grocery App. This project would not have been accomplished without their help and insights.

## Introduction

In this project, we are using MVVM (Model View ViewModel) for architectural patterns, Room for database, Co-routines and RecyclerView to display the list of items.

## Technologies-Used

- ### MVVM (Model View ViewModel)

  MVVM architecture in android is used to give structure to the project’s code and understand code easily. MVVM is an architectural design pattern in android. MVVM treat Activity classes and XML files as View. This design pattern separates UI from its logic. Here is an image to quickly understand MVVM.

- ### ROOM Database

  Room persistence library is a database management library and it is used to store the data of apps like grocery item name, grocery item quantity, and grocery item price. Room is a cover layer on SQLite which helps to perform the operation on the database easily.

- ### RecycleView

  RecyclerView is a container and it is used to display the collection of data in a large amount of data set that can be scrolled very effectively by maintaining a limited number of views.

- ### Co-routines

  Co-routines are a lightweight thread, we use a coroutine to perform an operation on other threads, by this our main thread doesn’t block and our app doesn’t crash.
